\arguments{
\item{emuDBhandle}{emuDB handle as returned by \link{load_emuDB}}

\item{itemsToDelete}{A data frame with the columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{session} (character)
\item \code{bundle} (character)
\item \code{start_item_id} (numeric)
}}

\item{sayYes}{When you call this function, it warns you about problems it
may create. You can skip that question if you set the \code{sayYes} parameter to
TRUE. This is useful when you want to use the function non-interactively.}

\item{rewriteAllAnnots}{should changes be written to file system (_annot.json
files) (intended for expert use only)}

\item{verbose}{if set to \code{TRUE}, more status messages are printed}
}
\description{
Delete annotation items programmatically. You have to pass in a
data frame, called \code{itemsToDelete}, describing these items. The required
columns are described below.

This function belongs to emuRâ€™s CRUD family of functions, which let the user
manipulate items programmatically:
\itemize{
\item Create items (\link{create_itemsInLevel})
\item Read items (\link{query})
\item Update items (\link{update_itemsInLevel})
\item Delete items (\link{delete_itemsInLevel}))
}
}
\details{
This function deletes annotation items from existing levels. Your input data
frame \code{itemsToDelete} must describe the items by specifying the columns
\code{session}, \code{bundle}, and \code{start_item_id}.

Be careful with this function: You can use it to create problematic situations,
for example gaps in the annotation levels, and the function currently has
no checks to prevent this. Instead, you need to explicitly confirm that you
are aware of this, either by setting \code{sayYes} to \code{TRUE} or by interactively
responding yes to the prompt this function presents.

A major use case for this function is to obtain a segment list using \link{query},
possibly modify the segment list and feed it to this function. That is why
the column \code{start_item_id} is not called \code{item_id}: segment lists include
the former column name, not the latter.
